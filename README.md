**GriSPy** is a regular grid search algorithm for quick nearest-neighbor lookup.

This class indexes a set of k-dimensional points in a regular grid providing a fast aproach for nearest neighbors queries. Optional periodic boundary conditions can be provided for each axis individually.

GriSPy has the following queries implemented:
- **bubble_neighbors**: find neighbors within a given radius. A different radius for each centre can be provided.
- **shell_neighbors**: find neighbors within given lower and upper radius. Different lower and upper radius can be provided for each centre.
- **nearest_neighbors**: find the nth nearest neighbors for each centre.

And the following method is available:
- **set_periodicity**: define the periodicity conditions.

--------------------------------

## Requirements

You need Python 3.6 or later to run GriSPy. You can have multiple Python
versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.


## Standard Installation

GriSPy is available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/grispy/). You can install it via the pip command

        $ pip install grispy

## Development Install

Clone this repo and then inside the local directory execute

        $ pip install -e .
